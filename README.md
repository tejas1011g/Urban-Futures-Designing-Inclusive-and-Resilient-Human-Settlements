# 🌆 Urban Futures: Designing Inclusive and Resilient Human Settlements

A data-driven case study focused on achieving **Sustainable Development Goal 11** — making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable through AI/ML and geospatial analysis.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

Urban areas are grappling with issues such as:
- Overcrowded slums
- Poor infrastructure
- Limited green spaces
- Escalating disaster risks

This project explores how data science and AI can be used to inform better urban planning policies and build resilient cities.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and interpret **SDG 11** indicators.
- Work with global urban sustainability datasets.
- Apply **GIS**, **Machine Learning**, and **AI** tools.
- Generate actionable insights for **urban governance**.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

To support the achievement of SDG 11, this project focuses on building an AI-driven pipeline to analyze urban indicators and support data-backed decision-making for city planning and policy.

## 📊 Datasets Used

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [UN-Habitat](https://data.unhabitat.org) | Urban indicators like slum population %, transport access, green spaces, and air quality |
| [NASA SEDAC](https://data.staging.idas-ds1.appdat.jsc.nasa.gov) | Spatial public-space access for 8,873 cities |
| [SpaceNet 7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04420) | Satellite imagery and building footprints for over 100 global regions |

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Acquire data from UN-Habitat, NASA SEDAC, and SpaceNet.
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalize, clean, and geo-reference datasets.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Urban density index
   - Green space ratio
   - Public transport accessibility
4. **Modeling**:
   - Regression models for predicting urban sustainability scores
   - R² Score achieved: **0.87**
   - Future metrics: MAE, RMSE, and Explained Variance

---

## 📈 Results

- Strong predictive performance with an R² of 0.87
- Clear insights into spatial inequalities and infrastructure gaps
- Visualizations of green space coverage and transport accessibility

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Integrate **disaster risk layers** (e.g., heat maps, flood zones)
- Use **digital twins** for urban simulations
- Include **citizen feedback** through participatory surveys
- Expand to more cities with **temporal analysis**
